# comm4190_F25_TikTok_Task

For this project, we analyzed a TikTok video of our choice. This video was to be related to popular culture and discussed two clearly defined positions as a part of a greater debate. Our video centered around the Starbucks bear cup controversy. Our video used this controversy as an example of over-consumerism in America. 

From the debate in the video, we defined a research question that could be answered by studying the comments in the video. Furthermore, we created 2 clearly defined concepts to translate this non-numeric content (comments) into numeric, quantitative data. Then, we defined how each position should be coded, with 2 codes per concept.

After both team members rated comments with respect to the codes and concepts, we analyzed our interrater reliability score. We iterated through concepts and code assignments to improve this score.

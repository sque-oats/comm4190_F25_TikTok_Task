    "**Description:** A woman discusses what she views as the embarassing culture of overconsumption in America, using the recent Starbucks Bear Cup craze as a key example supporting her claim. For context, Starbucks released a limited-edition cup in the shape of a teddy bear, and excited customers were camping outside Starbucks shops as early as the night before to try to retrieve one. As well, customers have been seen on video fighting each other and with Starbucks workers over these cups. <br>\n",
    "The comments *generally* either agree with the original poster points on calling waiting for Starbucks cups a worthless endeavor, while others say that the original poster shouldn't care what other people do with their lives."

    "Our original two concepts were:\n",

    "\n",
    "As we were working through our initial coding round, we ended up further refining our research question as we became more familiar with the comment database available to us. Initially, it was \"to what extent do the commentators agree with the video. However, as we noticed the variation in the amount of humor being used in the comments, we refined our research question into, \"to what extent do commentators use humor to criticize consumerist behavior?\" This change led to adjustments to our concepts. \n",

    "Our refined final concepts are:\n",
    "> **concept1** = \"Code 1 if the comment incorporates humor--use of laughing emojis, indirect humorous commentary, comparisons, sarcasm or irony, jokes, etc. Code 0 if the comment does not include humor or any of these elements.\"\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **concept2** = \"Code 1 if the comment directly criticizes consumerist behavior (e.g. agrees with the video, finds the situation embarassing, the commenter does not identify with the behavior, etc). Code 0 if the comment does not criticize consumerist behavior or does not specify one position.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As we coded, we realized that there were a few edge cases that our concepts didn't quite address. For example, comments that are more subtle or indirect in agreeing with the video (e.g. laughing, sharing analogies to the situation which may be seen as humorous, etc). We addressed the comments in different ways, and so to address this, we agreed that any subtlety that show agreement would be coded as 1 for concept 2. We included these specific cases in concept 2. Also, for the comments that both agreed and disagreed (e.g. Yes agree but you're also sad for caring so much), we decided to code them as 0 for concept 2."

    "It was a very long process to improve the inter-rater reliability scores between the LLM and our human coding. First, we realized quickly that the LLM was not the most adept at identifying humor and that it required much more guidance in identifying it. Due to this, we gave much more specific examples and instructions that were based on the actual comments and used its wording and incorporated it into the codebook in the LLM prompting. This would ensure that the LLM would be able to have more information on what specifically they could or could not include--thus, we had to ultimately moreso hardcode some items. In addition to this, another big change we made is how we structured the codebook as a whole. Originally, we only formatted the codebook as simply, \"code 1 for XXX, and code 0 for XXX.\" However, we found that revising the prompt to be, \"Code 1 if it includes at least one of the following elements: XXX. Code 0 if it does not have at least one of the elements above OR if it includes the following elements: XXX.\" We believe that this formatting was more efficient for our coding process because it introduced structure into how the LLM would follow a decision tree as it was coding between 1 and 0 for each concept. This added structure allowed for improvement to our inter-rater reliability scores."
